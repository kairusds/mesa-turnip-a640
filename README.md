# Mesa Turnip Adreno
Mesa Turnip builds for my personal use case

## Requirements
- Android 11+
- arm64 Snapdragon device

## Notice
So far, these builds have only been tested on a Poco X3 Pro and Poco F3, so I'm not sure if this will also work with other Snapdragon devices.
Feel free to post your experience on the Issues tab.
